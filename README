An important comment for the beginning: this is an old work from 2009 and is not in active development.
The second comment: Jan Busa, Jr. and I contributed to the work equally (~80% pair-programming).

Before installing feHMM, the Alberta has to be properly installed. Particularly the following system paths have to be set up (the best place is .bashrc file in your home directory)

export ALBERTA_INCLUDE_PATH=...
export ALBERTA_LIB_PATH=...
export ALBERTA_DATA_PATH=...

These assumptions should be already met if your Alberta is in use...

The installation of feHMM is 

1a	"./configure" 
or 
1b	"./configure --with-mpi" (if you do know what mpi is and you want it)
or 
1c	You are a guru and nothing can stop you. Aaaagrrrrrr!!!

2.	"make"

3.	"sudo make install" ((k)ubuntu, what else?)

Remark:
For new systems gfortran is the name of fortran compiler. You can then encounter problems with -lfrtbegin and -lg2c libraries when compiling. Simply adapt "$(ALBERTA_DATA_PATH)/Makefile.alberta" such that it contains
the line "FC = gfortran" instead of the original "FC = g77" and erase -lfrtbegin and -lg2c switches from the line beginning with "BLAS_LIB = ". 

After installation pop in the demo directory.

For the implementation details of the library read CODE_GUIDE.TXT.
