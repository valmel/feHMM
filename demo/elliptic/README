To run:
    make
    ./ellipt
The program saves the output to result.vt_. 
This is not a valid VTK file. 
Use VTKprocess.py macro to postprocess the result file in any way it suits you (or simply run VTKprocess.py 1 result.vt_ result.vtk ;)) 
You get a valid vtk file. We suggest you to try ParaView (www.paraview.org) to view results.

We kept the Albert(a) style of passing certain parameters at run time to the program, i.e we use "INIT/init.dat" file to pass
